# Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data

OpenStreetMap(OSM) is an open map database built by volunteers around the world. The data created are available for free use under the 
Open Database License. Pick any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as 
assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap 
data for a part of the world that you care about. 

Use MongoDB to store, query, and aggregate your data to answer questions about them.
